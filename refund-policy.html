            <h2>Conditions for Returns</h2>
            <p>In order for the Goods to be eligible for a return, please make sure that:</p>

                <li>The supply of Goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons
                    and were unsealed after delivery.</li>
                <li>The supply of Goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed with

                mailed to You.</p>
            <p>If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the Order shipped to
                themselves to give it to You later, We will send the refund to the gift giver.</p>
